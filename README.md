# E-commerce website 

## Description
   This is a Simple Web application that selling products. I allows user to do the folloing things:
   
   1. Users are able to register and login. User information will be stored in to a mysql table.
   2. Users are able to change their username and password.
   3. Users are able to add an item to cart. The items in cart will be saved. Items are still there after user logout and login again.
   4. Users are able to sort product based on it's category, server will only return the products in that category.
   
   This website is not done yet. 
   I want add "check order" which can let users see their placed order in the future. Also, I want to add a review function to let user leave reviews under each items.
